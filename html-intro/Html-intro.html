what is html?

html stands for hyper text markup language
html is the markup language that provides the foundation for building webpages
specifically html elements are the building blocks to build these web pages

right-click on browser then hit inspect or ctrl shift i for developer tools
boilerplate is just basic code that is neccesary for a certain file

usually tags without a slash are opening. for example: <html> is an opening
tags that begin with </ are a closing tag

this head is kinda like the brains of the html document

the body is where the elements on the page are written

<h1>s and <h2>s are common headers

<p> is a paragraph, also very common

<span> doesnt really represent anything on its own but can be styled differently

the <div> element has no special meaning at all, its used mostly as a container for a group of elements
